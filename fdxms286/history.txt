Development history of FDXMS286:

What's up with the version numbers? Wait and see. Or guess.

Version 0.03.Temperaments - 2005-05-28 - Martin Str”mberg

- Severe error when moving more than 0x2000 bytes of data to/from XMS
  corrected.
- Thank you to Eric Auer for testing.


Version 0.02.Semplice - 2005-05-05 - Martin Str”mberg

- print_string.inc was missing from the source.
- INT15 parameter added.
- Only warn that A20 can't be disabled instead of refusing to load.
- Changed VDISK detection to preserve A20 state.
- VDISK detection in check_vdisk corrected by Lixing Yuan.
- Unecessary pushf/popfs removed from int2f_handler.
- Modify int15_handler to not clobber return flags when function 0x87
  is forwarded to previous int15 handler.
- Added proper handling of input and output status device commands
  according to information from Bob Smith.
- Squeezed away some bytes by setting up the handle table completely at
  initialisation time.
- Size optimisations.
- Major redesign of the dispatching of XMS calls and return from them
  resulting in size reduction. 


Version 0.01.Espansiva - 2002-03-29 - Martin Str”mberg

- Perhaps other changes that have been forgotten (sorry!).
- Albert and Aitor tested many many versions to get FDXMS286 working
	on 286 PS machines.
- Merged in some changes from FDXMS 0.9.Sand.
- Removed INT15 AX=0xe820 and INT15 AX=0xe801 calls for detecting XMS
	memory size. FDXMS286 only uses INT15 AH=0x88 to find memory.
- Removed all XXMS handling.
- Removed BIOS argument handling.
- Removed FDXMS protected mode switching so FDXMS286 always uses the
	BIOS for XMS moves.
- Took FDXMS 0.8.Grains and converted all 386 code to 286 code.
