* Is there a race while allocating a handle? Like this: a call to
	xms_alloc_xms, interrupt occurs giving control to interrupt
	routine that calls xms_alloc_xms -> bang!


For much later:

* Somebody (I've forgotten whom, sorry) suggested to show the trace
        lines on a monocrome grafics adapter if installed. While I
        think it's a good idea, I'm not inclined to do it as I don't
        have the necessary hardware.
